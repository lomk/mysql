#This finds 99.99% of all errors. 
#What it cannot find is corruption that involves only the data file
myisamchk tbl_name

#This finds 99.999% of all errors. 
#It first checks all index entries for errors and then reads through all rows. 
#It calculates a checksum for all key values in the rows 
#and verifies that the checksum matches the checksum for the keys in the index tree.
myisamchk -m tbl_name


#This does a complete and thorough check of all data (-e means “extended check”). 
#It does a check-read of every key for each row to verify that they indeed point to the correct row
myisamchk -e tbl_name
